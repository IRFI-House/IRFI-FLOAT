### 🔁 Pull Request Requirements

- Keep your naming and structure consistent with existing files

All pull requests are subject to **review and approval** by the IRFI HOUSE maintainer.

## 🧱 Mapping Style & Direction

To ensure visual and functional cohesion:

- Use **modular and optimized design**
- Stay within the **floaty / luxury / immersive RP vibe**
- Avoid excessive clutter or props that break the intended atmosphere
- Try to reuse GTA V assets and materials when possible

If you're unsure, open a discussion before working — we love to coordinate with contributors.

## 🛑 Respect the Project Identity

This is a collective and open initiative, but it must remain respectful and coherent.

Please avoid:
- Claiming the work as your own
- Submitting intentionally broken or trollish content
- Using this project as a base for **commercial reselling**

You can develop your own fork or variant **as long as** it respects the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) and includes proper attribution.
